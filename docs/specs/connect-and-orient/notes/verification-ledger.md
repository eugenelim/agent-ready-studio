# Verification ledger — Connect and Orient

Execution observations for run `f87c797b-8bed-46c2-96fd-e8d22fb8eb3d`. This file
records observed behaviour; it holds no obligations. The approved `spec.md` and
`plan.md` retain the obligations, and this ledger is deliberately not hash-pinned.

## t1-evidence

**T1 — the hostile corpus exists and every probe is proven non-vacuous.** Gates AC-0149.

- Files: `apps/studio-service/src/trials/connect-and-orient-runtime/test/hostile-fixture.ts`
  and `hostile-fixture.test.ts`.
- Approved red stub materialized byte-identically from `plan.md`; verified by direct
  comparison against the plan's fenced block, and re-verified after two later
  formatter passes.
- Corpus enumerates 19 cases and binds them to criteria: AC-0133 through AC-0146 plus
  the bounds criteria AC-0037, AC-0050, AC-0051, AC-0075 and AC-0104. This makes the
  phrase "the bounds criteria" in AC-0149 concrete and enumerable.
- AC-0149's corrected construction rule is exercised: the checkout-observable
  `.git`-variant case is built into the source object database before checkout, and a
  test asserts its presence there rather than on disk afterwards.
- Gates at completion: lint 0, typecheck 0, test 0 (243 tests / 24 files at that point),
  build 0, `verify` 0, `git diff --check` 0, both spec linters 0.

**Observed fragility.** `AC-0147 a hook probe fires when the guard is removed` spawns a
real `git` checkout with hooks. It completed in 5500 ms against vitest's 5000 ms default
during one full-suite run and failed that run; it passed 3 of 3 runs in isolation
(41/41 each) and passed in every other full-suite run. The test is load-sensitive rather
than incorrect. Recorded, not repaired: repairing a completed task's timing is out of
T1's scope. Same class as the pre-existing Electron cold-cache timeout.

## t2-evidence

**T2 — a submitted URL becomes a canonical identity or a named refusal.** Gates AC-0001
through AC-0007 and AC-0010. AC-0008 and AC-0009 are deliberately not T2's; they were
moved to T3 before execution because a pure no-I/O module cannot observe a
remote-reported ref or a redirect.

- Files: `apps/studio-service/src/source-identity.ts` and `source-identity.test.ts`.
- Approved red stub materialized byte-identically from `plan.md`.

**Mutation proofs — 9 of 9 observed red.** Each mutation was applied, the test file run,
and the source restored by editing. No `git checkout`, `reset`, or `stash` was used.

| Invariant | Mutation | Observed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Embedded credentials refused (AC-0003) | credential guard forced false | tests exit 1 |
| Scheme is https (AC-0002) | scheme check removed | tests exit 1 |
| Host is exactly `github.com` (AC-0002) | exact compare weakened to `endsWith` | tests exit 1 |
| Any explicit port refused (AC-0002) | `carriesExplicitPort` forced false | tests exit 1 |
| Path is the repository main page (AC-0004) | path widened to accept trailing segments | tests exit 1 |
| Owner/repository charset (AC-0006) | charset check disabled | tests exit 1 |
| Requested-ref charset (AC-0007) | ref check disabled | tests exit 1 |
| Fetch target built from canonical identity (AC-0010) | non-canonical text appended | tests exit 1 |
| Percent-decoding precedes charset validation (AC-0005/AC-0006) | decoding removed | tests exit 1 |

The last one is the load-bearing case: without decoding before validation, `%2F`
reaches the owner/repository value intact.

## t3-evidence

**T3 — a remote ref resolves to a verified exact commit.** Gates AC-0008, AC-0009,
AC-0011, AC-0012, AC-0013, AC-0014. **Complete under the narrowed AC-0009.** The
criterion's automated obligation is the presence of `http.followRedirects=false` on both
argument vectors, which the driver satisfies and which mutation 6 below proves
falsifiable. The behavioural observation is T13's manual smoke and is not T3's.

- Files: `apps/studio-service/src/trials/connect-and-orient-runtime/git-driver.ts` and
  `git-driver.test.ts`. The git driver is trial code and is imported by nothing outside
  the trial root.
- Approved red stub materialized byte-identically from `plan.md`.
- AC-0008 is enforced by reusing T2's `canonicalizeSource` on the remote-reported ref,
  rather than by a second copy of the ref charset.
- AC-0014 is discharged at its nearest in-process contract: the result exposes the exact
  40-character SHA and an abbreviation never replaces it. The rendered assertion is a
  deferred assertion for T12.
- AC-0022's completeness obligation (every `git` vector carries the *complete* pinned
  configuration) is T4's, not T3's. T3 pins only `http.followRedirects=false`; T4 must
  extend this to the full pinned set.

**Mutation proofs — 11 of 11 observed red**, applied and restored by editing.

| Invariant | Mutation | Observed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Remote-reported ref charset (AC-0008) | charset check forced false | tests exit 1 |
| Resolved SHA is 40 lowercase hex (AC-0011) | exact-SHA check removed | tests exit 1 |
| Ref never occupies resolved SHA (AC-0013) | branch name assigned to `resolvedSha` | tests exit 1 |
| `HEAD` mismatch refused (AC-0012) | mismatch refusal forced false | tests exit 1 |
| Exact SHA retained in result (AC-0014) | SHA truncated to 12 chars | tests exit 1 |
| Redirect refusal on every vector (AC-0009) | `http.followRedirects=false` dropped | tests exit 1 |
| Absolute git executable (AC-0020) | `isAbsolute` guard removed | tests exit 1 |
| End-of-options marker on `ls-remote` (AC-0021) | `--` dropped | tests exit 1 |
| End-of-options marker on `fetch` (AC-0021) | `--` dropped | tests exit 1 |
| Checkout uses the fetched revision (AC-0012) | `FETCH_HEAD` replaced with `HEAD` | tests exit 1 |
| `HEAD` read inside the supplied root (AC-0012) | `cwd` omitted from `rev-parse` | tests exit 1 |

> section is retained because the `contract-amendment` engine event records it as the

**The gap, as it then stood.** AC-0009 then required every redirect to be refused during
both resolution and materialization, observed against the git client that performs it.
Redirect handling lives in git's HTTP client, so observing it requires an HTTP exchange,
while AC-0148 required every added test to pass with no network access.

**What was proven, and still is.** The argument-level contract: `http.followRedirects=false`
is present on every resolution and materialization vector, and removing it fails a test
(mutation 6 in `t3-evidence`).

**What was then thought missing.** A hermetic git endpoint on loopback emitting redirects
during both `ls-remote` and `fetch`, plus a positive control. See
`probe-2026-09-15-git-transport-and-tls`: that route cannot be reached under the pinned
contract. **It is no longer outstanding work.** AC-0009 was narrowed so its automated
obligation is exactly the argument-level pin already proven, and the behavioural
observation moved to T13's manual smoke against the real remote.

## owner-decision-2026-09-15-loopback-https

> **SUPERSEDED on 2026-09-15** by `owner-decision-2026-09-15-narrow-ac-0009` below.

The scope owner decided on 2026-09-15 to read AC-0148's "no network access" as
forbidding access to any remote service or non-loopback address, and to permit a
hermetic loopback endpoint for tests that can be satisfied no other way. The decision
was taken after being shown three options: permit loopback, accept a bounded known gap,
or narrow AC-0009 and move its behavioural claim to T13's manual smoke. The owner chose
to permit loopback because it is the only option that discharges AC-0009, and a loopback
endpoint contacts no remote service, which is the exposure AC-0148 exists to prevent.

This authorizes a controlled contract amendment to AC-0148's wording and the
corresponding T3 test obligation. It authorizes nothing else: no credential path, no
external network, and no widening of the permitted executables, environment allowlist,
pinned git configuration, or resource bounds.


## probe-2026-09-15-git-transport-and-tls

Commands Claude executed on this host while adjudicating the loopback proposal.

| Probe | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| http under the transport pin | `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=https git ls-remote http://127.0.0.1:PORT/x.git` | `fatal: transport 'http' not allowed` |
| https, pinned config only | `git -c http.followRedirects=false ls-remote https://127.0.0.1:PORT/x.git` against a self-signed loopback TLS server | exit 128, `SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate` |
| https, plus a trust term | the same with `-c http.sslVerify=false` | exit 128, `repository not found` — TLS accepted, git proceeded |

These establish that a hermetic loopback endpoint is unreachable under the unchanged
contract: http is refused by `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=https`, and https requires
`http.sslVerify=false` or an equivalent CA trust term, which is absent from the pinned
`git` configuration and which AC-0022, AC-0023 and AC-0024 would forbid adding.

## owner-decision-2026-09-15-narrow-ac-0009

The scope owner decided on 2026-09-15, after the probe above and after two independent
reviews and their adjudications both returned the same indeterminate owner-choice stop,
to **reverse the AC-0148 widening and narrow AC-0009 instead**.

The owner was shown three options: authorize a named test-scoped TLS trust term, accept a
bounded known gap with AC-0009's text unchanged, or narrow AC-0009 so the contract matches
its evidence. The owner chose to narrow.

Effects, all applied in one action:

- AC-0148 returns to its original wording. No network surface is admitted. This deletes
  the two sustained secure-design concerns about listener binding, name resolution, and
  binding the proof's `git` process to the shipped environment, because the surface those
  concerns governed no longer exists.
- AC-0009's automated obligation becomes the presence of `http.followRedirects=false` on
  every resolution and materialization argument vector, which is falsifiable by dropping
  the key and is already proven. The criterion now states explicitly that it claims no
  automated observation of client behaviour.
- The behavioural observation moves to T13's manual smoke, which contacts github.com by
  design and already exists.
- Both Testing Strategy groups and T3's task prose were restated to match; T3's Approach
  no longer names the local-remote stand-in the transport pin refuses.

**What this costs, recorded plainly:** there is no automated regression guard on real
client redirect behaviour. A future change that removed redirect refusal in a way the
argument vector still satisfied would be caught only by the manual smoke. No security
control was widened to obtain this, and the contract no longer claims evidence that does
not exist.

## t1-test-timeout-2026-09-15

T1's fixture tests build real git repositories and, for the positive controls, spawn git.
Under concurrent machine load they exceeded vitest's 5000 ms default — 6888 ms, 9481 ms
and 12929 ms observed across three tests in one run — while passing 41/41 in three
consecutive isolated runs. Owner-approved repair: a file-level
`vi.setConfig({ testTimeout: 60_000, hookTimeout: 60_000 })` in
`hostile-fixture.test.ts`. It changes no assertion and no behaviour, and it was placed at
file level rather than per test so the approved AC-0147 stub block stays byte-identical to
`plan.md`. Verified after the change: all three stubs still byte-identical, and
`hostile-fixture.test.ts` no longer appears in any failure.

## preexisting-flake-ac-32

`AC-32 serves, reloads, and closes cleanly within five seconds` in
`apps/studio-service/src/service.integration.test.ts` fails intermittently under load,
observed at 2063 ms against its own 2000 ms request timeout and at 3451 ms and 3639 ms in
earlier runs. **It is not this delivery's test** and the file is untouched by this work;
AC-0148 is scoped to tests this delivery adds. Recorded rather than repaired, because
fixing another delivery's test would broaden scope. It is the same class as the
pre-existing Electron cold-cache timeout the plan's Risks section already names. A gate
run that trips it should be repeated on an unloaded machine.

## t3-closure-2026-09-15

T3 completed under the narrowed AC-0009 with no further implementation: the driver already
carried `http.followRedirects=false` on every resolution and materialization vector, which
is the criterion's whole automated obligation, and mutation 6 in `t3-evidence` proves it
falsifiable. Gates at closure: lint 0, typecheck 0, test 0 (263 tests / 27 files), build 0,
`git diff --check` 0, both spec linters 0. Engine advanced to wave 2 (T4).
