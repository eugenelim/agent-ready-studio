"""Decide whether an artifact's status is terminal, for the closure check.

**These are read-side projections, not defining homes.** A closure verdict rests
on terminality, and the surfaces that own it sit in sibling skills that this one
may not reach: a cross-skill relative import is not portable across adapter
projections, copying a module between skill ``scripts/`` directories is banned,
and a new ``shared-libs`` boundary is outside this change. A projection pinned by
a parity assertion is the only remaining shape, so each declaration names the
upstream it derives from and a gate-chain step re-checks the agreement against
the live corpus on every pull request.

Three asymmetries are deliberate.

**Intents are enumerated; briefs are derived; specs are partially enumerated.**
No shipped surface marks an intent status terminal — ``intent_shape.STATUS_VALUES``
is a flat tuple and its state-coherence table constrains which *records* a status
requires, not whether the status ends anything. So the intent set is written out
here and pinned against the parent intent's prose table. Briefs are the opposite:
terminality is already derivable from the shipped transition table's
no-outgoing-edge property, so it is derived rather than restated. Specs are
between the two: the vocabulary has a shipped home
(``lint-spec-status.py :: CANONICAL_STATUSES``), and this projection is pinned
against it; but no transition table exists for specs, so the terminal subset
(``Shipped``, ``Archived``) is enumerated here because no upstream carries it.

Do not confuse any of these with ``workspace_status_engine._TERMINAL_STATUS_BY_KIND``,
which maps ``intent`` to ``{Accepted, Fulfilled}`` and ``spec`` to ``{Shipped}``
only. That is collection-routing terminality — the status at which a kind rests
in its current collection — and reusing it here would make ``Accepted`` terminal
for intents and omit ``Archived`` for specs. Both are wrong: ``Accepted`` is live
work, and ``Archived`` is a lifecycle-terminal spec status carried by 6 specs in
the live corpus (measured 2026-09-27).

**An unknown status is live, never terminal.** ``eligible`` authorises a
terminal write, so the direction that refuses to authorise is the safe one. This
matters most for briefs: a typo and an upstream addition both have no outgoing
edge, so the edge table alone would call them terminal.
