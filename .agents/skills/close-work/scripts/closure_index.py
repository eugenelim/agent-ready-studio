"""Per-decision in-memory descendant index for the closure eligibility check.

Module-private construction: only the closure check's entry point may call
``_build_descendant_closure``. A test enumerates its callers (AC-0026, T4).

**Nothing in this module writes to disk or to environment variables.** The
returned dict is built inside the caller's frame and garbage-collected when
that frame ends (AC-0023). No state persists across decisions (AC-0021).

**Each call to the entry point re-reads all inputs.** No descendant set,
index, or verdict is cached between calls (AC-0021). A second decision over the
same tree after a status mutation sees the new value because every artifact file
is re-opened from scratch.

**The entry point refuses when HEAD is not current against the merge target**
(AC-0022). A ``_freshness_checker`` seam (default: git-based) is called first
and returns one of three values: ``True`` (fresh — proceed), ``False`` (stale —
refuse with ``stale-base``), or ``None`` (indeterminate — refuse with
``freshness-indeterminate``). Indeterminate cases include git being unavailable,
a subprocess timeout, and *root* not being a git repository. They resolve
**closed** — a closure decision authorises a terminal write, so "unable to
determine" is not the same as "determined fresh" and is treated as a blocker.
The one case that resolves fresh without checking staleness is when no tracking
branch is configured: there is nothing to be stale against.

**Each artifact file is opened at most once per decision** (AC-0024). A
visited set tracks physically opened paths; a field cache stores preamble
fields so that subsequent membership checks use the cache rather than
re-reading the file. The diamond case — one file encountered as a candidate
in two separate collection scans — is handled by returning cached fields on
the second encounter without calling the reader.

**Discovery is driven exclusively by the ``Decomposed:`` terminus at each
level** (AC-0025). A terminus names one of three collections: ``children``
maps to the intents directory, ``brief`` maps to the briefs directory (plus
the specs directory for that brief's specs), and ``spec`` maps to the specs
directory. No other directory is enumerated. A collection-directory cache
ensures dir_lister is called at most once per directory per decision.

**Reads per decision are bounded by the summed size of the named
collections** (AC-0037). Because each artifact in each named collection is
physically read at most once, the reader call count cannot exceed the total
file count across the collections the termini name.

**``Discovery:`` targets are confined to the repository root** (trust
boundary). The default reader uses the co-located ``file_safety.py``
projection of the blessed ``agentbundle.catalogue_tooling.file_safety``
helper, which calls ``read_confined_regular_file`` and raises
``UnsafeContentError`` (a ``ValueError`` subclass) on any escape — a
``..`` segment, an absolute path that lands outside the root, or a symlink
— before the target file is opened.  ``_get_fields`` catches both
``OSError`` and ``ValueError`` and treats either as an unreadable artifact,
so a confined violation contributes no descendant edge and does not crash
the decision.  An injected ``_reader`` seam (test use only) bypasses this
check; the seam is trusted because tests control their own filesystem.

Projection note: ``TERMINUS_VOCABULARY`` is a local projection of
``intent_shape.DECOMPOSITION_TERMINI``. A cross-skill relative import is
forbidden by the catalogue authoring standards; the upstream is stated as a
comment and the parity check that keeps them in sync lives in T4's caller-
enumeration test.

    - ``False`` — **stale**: the tracking branch has commits that HEAD does not
      contain; HEAD needs a fast-forward or rebase before this closing edge.
    - ``None``  — **indeterminate**: could not determine staleness because ``git``
      is unavailable (``FileNotFoundError``), the subprocess timed out, or
      *root* is not a git repository.

    Indeterminate resolves **closed** (the entry point refuses with
    ``freshness-indeterminate``).  A closure decision authorises a terminal write;
    "unable to determine" is not the same as "determined fresh", and the spec's
    risk rule ("every ambiguous case resolves toward refuse") applies here as
    much as it does to an unrecognised descendant status.

    The one case that resolves ``True`` without performing a staleness check is
    "no tracking branch configured" — that is a legitimate state, not an error.

    Implementation: three ``git`` subprocess calls with ``cwd=root``.

    1. ``git rev-parse --git-dir`` — confirms *root* is inside a git repository.
       A non-zero exit means it is not; returns ``None`` (indeterminate).

    3. ``git merge-base --is-ancestor @{u} HEAD`` — exit 0 means the upstream is
       an ancestor of HEAD (fresh); non-zero means stale.

    set minimal (this path is not exercised in every call).

    Up-edges by artifact kind (AC-0002):

    - ``spec``: ``Discovery:`` (resolved to a path in the intents directory)
      OR ``Brief:`` → that brief's ``Parent intent:``.  A ``Brief: none`` spec
      reaches its ancestor only through ``Discovery:``, covering the 12 of 24
      decomposed corpus intents whose termini are ``spec``.
    - ``brief``: ``Parent intent:``.
    - ``intent``: ``Parent intent:``.

    A ``Discovery:`` value whose resolved path is not in the intents directory
    contributes no edge rather than failing the decision (AC-0003).

    Called from close-work's closeout procedure alongside
    ``check_ancestor_closure`` to fire the check on every intent ancestor of
    the transitioning artifact (AC-0001).

    - ``ClosureNotEligible``: at least one descendant is live; names all of them.
    - ``ClosureEligible``: all preconditions met and all descendants terminal.
      When ``_decider`` is supplied, ``ClosureEligible.packet`` carries the
      six-field evidence packet (AC-0027).

    This is the **only** function permitted to call ``_build_descendant_closure``
    (AC-0026). The caller-enumeration test in ``test_closure_entry.py`` asserts
    this invariant and fails when a second caller is added.

    **AC-0022** — the first action is the freshness check. ``_freshness_checker``
    is a test seam; the production default is ``_make_default_freshness_checker(root)``,
    which calls ``git`` with three subprocess steps.  The checker returns
    ``bool | None``:

    - ``True``  — fresh; proceed.
    - ``False`` — stale; refuse with ``stale-base``.
    - ``None``  — indeterminate (git unavailable, timeout, or root is not a git
      repository); refuse with ``freshness-indeterminate``.

    Tests inject ``lambda: True``, ``lambda: False``, or ``lambda: None`` to
    drive each arm without a live git repository.

    **AC-0021** — every input is re-resolved on each call. No descendant set,
    index, or verdict is reused across calls. ``_build_descendant_closure`` builds
    a new in-memory dict each time; the dict is local to this call's frame.

    **AC-0027 / AC-0028 / AC-0031 / AC-0034 / AC-0035** — when ``_decider``
    is supplied and the verdict is ``ClosureEligible``, ``_build_eligible_packet``
    is called with the resolved descendants and the caller-supplied context.
    ``_ancestor_fields`` carries the ancestor's full preamble fields so the packet
    can include the ratified ``Decomposed:`` value and any ``Outcome co-owner:``.
    ``_workspace_lookup`` and ``_disposition_lookup`` are test seams; the production
    caller supplies its own implementations.
