"""Decide the metadata shape contract for a repository intent.

This module is the single home for the field rules, and a reviewer or a lint
carrying its own copy of the table is a second home that drifts from this one.

Two surfaces read it. ``validate_live_intent`` decides a rule from one artifact
alone, and is the surface the shaping reviewer's preamble condition refers to —
that condition names the obligation and defers every member list here rather
than restating it. ``validate_corpus_scoped`` is the corpus-only entry point;
it delegates to ``validate_supersession`` and ``_check_state_coherence``, so a
rule added to either reaches every consumer without the consumer changing.

**Surface placement rule.** Among the rules deciding a live intent, a rule
whose verdict depends only on the field it constrains belongs on the shared
surface; a rule whose verdict depends on a different field's value, or on
another artifact, belongs on the corpus-lint-only surface. "Only the field it
constrains" covers that field's presence, its name, how often it occurs, its
value, and — where its value gates whether the check runs at all — a fixed
location in the same artifact.

The state-coherence rules use the corpus-lint-only surface because each rule's
verdict depends on ``Status``, a different field from the one constrained. Every
refusal they produce carries one of the classes declared in
``LIFECYCLE_REFUSAL_CLASSES``:

- ``lifecycle_record_required`` — a status requires a record that is absent.
- ``lifecycle_record_not_allowed`` — a status forbids a record that is present.

What a shaping reviewer then emits is not this module's to state: it retrieves
nothing, so that depends on what a caller puts in its packet.

Two properties are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

Normalization runs once per value, **comment first, then backticks**. The
corpus's dominant shape is ``- **Slug:** `value` <!-- ... -->``, where the
comment trails the closing backtick. Stripping backticks first no-ops on that
shape, because the line does not end in a backtick, and every later rule then
judges a value that is still quoted.

The preamble is a **bounded region**, not a pattern: the run of visible lines
before the first ``## `` heading. A ``- **Status:**`` line can sit inside a
de-risk record body, where its value is a probe's narrative, and a bolded
``- **Authority:**`` line can sit inside ``## Source``, where it is an owner
attribution rather than the governance pointer the preamble field holds. A
whole-file pattern match corrupts both. HTML comment regions are not visible
preamble content, and an unclosed region hides the remainder.

A field name absent from the table is accepted. That is what keeps
``Milestone:`` and any future organic field passing while the six retired names
fail, and it is why the retired-name rule needs both halves.
