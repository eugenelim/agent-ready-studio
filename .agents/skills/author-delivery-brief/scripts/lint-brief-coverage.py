"""Brief-coverage auto-rollup lint.

This is an `author-delivery-brief` **skill script**: it lives at
`packs/core/.apm/skills/author-delivery-brief/scripts/lint-brief-coverage.py`
and projects to every adapter's `.../skills/author-delivery-brief/scripts/`, the same way
the work-loop's `lint-spec-status.py` does. The agent runs it after a slice's
status changes; it can also run as a **fail-closed CI gate** where a PR event
and Python both exist. It no-ops gracefully where Python is absent.

What it does: reads every brief and mapped spec `Status:` field, follows the
`Brief:` back-links, and checks the brief lifecycle against its child specs.
It reports delivery only after the brief is explicitly `Shipped`; it introduces
no new state and never mutates a status.

Rollup rules:
  - A brief is *delivered* only when its own status is `Shipped`, its Spec map
    is non-empty, and every mapped spec is `Shipped`.
  - `Draft`, `Ready`, and `Withdrawn` have no `Implementing` or `Shipped`
    child. `Executing` and `Cancelled` have at least one. `Shipped` has only
    `Shipped` children and cannot have an empty map.
  - A spec that back-links a brief but is absent from that brief's Spec map is
    reported **untracked** — informational, never an error. The canonical
    back-link is the path form pinned by the owning guide § Spec metadata
    contract; the bare `Slug:` spelling is still matched here for backward
    compatibility only.
  - A `docs/product/briefs/_template.md` (or any `_`-prefixed file) is the
    shipped template, not a brief; it is skipped.

Exit codes:
  0 = clean (coverage reported; warnings/untracked allowed).
  1 = drift: a brief's Spec map records a status that contradicts the spec's
      actual `Status:` (a hand-edited, now-stale cell). The Status column is
      auto-derived and must not be hand-maintained — drift is the failure this
      lint exists to catch. An unset cell (`<auto>`, `—`, `-`, or empty) means
      "not yet derived" and is reported, not failed.

No briefs found → exit 0 with no diagnostic output (the common case in a repo
that ships no brief). Usage: lint-brief-coverage.py [--root DIR]

    - A repeated ``## Spec map`` heading therefore re-opens the section
      rather than closing it.  Its check must run before the terminator, or a
      second ``## Spec map`` would close the section instead.

    - A comment that opens and closes within one line leaves the row parsed
      and the recorded status unchanged: the raw ``line`` is parsed so that
