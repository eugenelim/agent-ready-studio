"""Vocabulary, coherence rules, and bounded preamble reader for delivery briefs.

This module is the single home for the brief state vocabulary, the child-
execution-evidence predicate, the legal transition set, and the bounded preamble
reader.  A reviewer or a lint carrying its own copy of any of these is a second
home that can drift from this one.

The brief state table lives in the spec that owns this module's docstring.
This module implements that table; its docstring cites rather than restating it.

**Two mirrors are maintained by hand** because cross-skill import is banned:

- ``extract_token`` mirrors ``lint-spec-status.extract_status_token`` (same
  delimiters: `` (```, `` →``, and ``<!--``).  Keep them in lockstep.
- The ``Cut-closed:`` date-grammar check mirrors ``intent_shape._check_dated_evidence``
  (same partition-at-first-space rule).  Keep them in lockstep.

Both mirrors are hand-held by design; this docstring is the only thing that
makes their absence visible.

**Refusal registry** — every refusal this module raises corresponds to one of
the following classes.  Keep this list equal to the set of errors the module
actually raises; update it in the same change that adds or removes one.

- ``cut_closed_malformed`` — a ``Cut-closed:`` value that is not absent-
  equivalent and does not follow the ISO 8601 date + evidence grammar.
- ``cut_closed_required_on_shipped`` — a ``Shipped`` brief carries no
  ``Cut-closed:`` record.
- ``cut_closed_refused_on_draft`` — a ``Draft`` brief carries a
  ``Cut-closed:`` record.

# What counts as a section heading, for every reader of a brief.
#
# Matched against the RAW line, not the comment-stripped text.  That is what
# tells a real heading from one preceded on its own line by comment text:
# `  ## Outcome` is a heading, while `--> ## Outcome` and `<!-- n --> ## Outcome`
# carry `##` as a live *suffix* after a comment and are not.  Those two share
# an identical live suffix and differ only in where the comment opened, so the
# comment state alone cannot separate them -- it is kept as a second guard so a
# heading sitting wholly inside a comment never counts.
#
# Whitespace follows CommonMark throughout, so the rule is one rule: at most
# three leading spaces (four, or a tab, is an indented code block), and a space
# or a tab after the hashes, with a bare `##` an empty heading.

# ...`) are not read as fields. Loosening it to tolerate a leading prefix
