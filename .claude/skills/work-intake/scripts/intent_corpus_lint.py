"""Lint a directory of repository intents against the metadata shape contract.

Usage: python3 intent_corpus_lint.py --dir <repo-relative dir> [--root <path>]

Every file in the directory is routed to exactly one of two contracts by the
partition rule — a file is a tombstone if and only if its *preamble* carries a
``Tombstone:`` field — and then validated against that contract. No file is
skipped: a directory entry the lint does not route is a gap the exit code
cannot express, so routing is reported alongside the violations.

Exit codes follow the sibling allocator's posture rather than a lint's
convention. 0 is clean. 1 means at least one file is non-conforming. 2 means
the corpus could not be fully read, which is reported as its own state because
"no violations found" and "clean" are different claims about a corpus whose
files the lint could not open.

The preamble bound matters here twice. It decides the partition, so a
body-level ``Tombstone:`` line inside a narrative does not retire a live
intent, and it decides every field rule the live contract applies.
